# AssemblyAI


## What is AssemblyAI?



## Storing your API key
A standard and safe way to store your API key is by:
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='yourkey'" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export ASSEMBLY_API_KEY='yourkey'" >> ~/.bash_profile

where 'yourkey' is your API key. And '~/.bash_profile' loads the key into your environment.
